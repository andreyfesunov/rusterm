## alternatives

- [Wetty](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/wetty): Node based web terminal.
- [GoTTY](https://github.com/yudai/gotty): Go based web terminal.
- [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd): C++ based web terminal.

There are no daemon options in alternatives, that is why I created rusterm.
